The object of the Trial of the Outer Spiral is to get through all 100 floors of the randomly generated trial. Each floor is filled with Enemies 
which are trying to stop you. Run or fight is up to you but you must find the down portal on each floor in order to proceed. You will also find items along the floor which will help you on your journey. Items include weapons,
